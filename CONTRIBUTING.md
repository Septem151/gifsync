# Contributing
There are two main ways to start developing and contributing to GifSync: **Docker Compose** (all dependencies and python
requirements are hosted in a container), or a **Local Build** (dependencies and python must be installed locally).

All Linux commands assume you are running a debian-based system. All Windows commands assume you are running Windows 10.

## Docker Compose
### Prerequisites (Docker)
* Docker and Docker Compose
  * Linux
    ```sh
    # DOCKER
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker-ce
    sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
    # Restart your computer through GUI or use "sudo shutdown -r now"
    
    # Verify docker is installed
    docker --version
    
    # DOCKER-COMPOSE
    # Confirm that the release number for docker-compose matches
    # the latest release at https://github.com/docker/compose/releases
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    
    # Verify docker-compose is installed
    docker-compose --version
    ```
  * Windows
    * Docker does not natively run on windows and will require installing the Linux Kernel Update Package provided by
    Microsoft, enabling Virtualization, and potentially enabling Hyper-V.
    The setup for Docker Desktop varies based on if you are running [Windows 10 Home][docker-windows-home-url] or 
    [Windows 10 Pro/Education/Enterprise][docker-windows-url]
### Environment Setup (Docker)
1. Fork the Repository on GitHub
    * It is recommended that you fork the repository so you can push changes and submit pull requests.

2. Clone the forked Repository locally
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/gifsync.git
    cd gifsync
    ```

3. Create two new files called **web.env** and **db.env** within the project's root directory.
    * Populate **db.env** with the following:
        ```
        POSTGRES_USER=postgres
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpassword
        ```
    * **web.env** must have `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` defined (see 
    [Additional Information](#additional-information) for getting a Spotify Client & Secret ID). Populate **web.env** 
    with the following:
        ```
        CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
        CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
        DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:devpassword@db:5432/postgres
        ```
    * Optional values for **web.env** include:
        * `FLASK_ENV` - recommended value: `development`
        * `SECRET_KEY` - not necessary to set, defaults to `devkey`
        * `PORT` - if set, you **MUST** change the port definition within the `docker-compose.yml` file to match

5. Run `docker-compose up --build -d` (omit the "-d" flag if you wish to keep the containers attached to the terminal, 
useful for debugging)
    * To view the site, open a browser and go to `localhost:8000` or to the port you've specified in `web.env`
    * Changes made to **HTML** and **CSS** will be reflected automatically after waiting approx. 10-15 seconds.
    * Changes to **code** will **NOT** be reflected automatically. Restart the server with `docker-compose down`, then 
    `docker-compose up --build -d`.

## Local Build
### Prerequisites (Local)
* Python 3 and Pip
    * Linux
        ```sh
        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
        sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
        ```
    * Windows
        * [Download and Install the latest Python 3 release][windows-python-url]
            * IMPORTANT: When installing, please check "Add Python 3.x to PATH"
            * (Optional) When installing, select "Disable path length limit" (this may resolve some bugs)
* PostgreSQL / Psql
    * Docker
        * I highly recommend using Docker for PostgreSQL. Please see the [Docker Prerequisites](#prerequisites-docker) 
        section for help setting up Docker, then proceed with the next steps.
        * Follow steps 1 & 2 in [Environment Setup (Local)](#environment-setup-local), then run the following command:
            ```sh
            docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up --build -d
            ```
        * Open a web browser and go to `localhost:8080`. Within the Adminer console, select/enter the following:
            - System: PostgreSQL
            - Server: db
            - Username: postgres
            - Password: devpassword
            - Database: postgres
        * Click on "Import" near the left-hand side, and under "File upload" select the file `db_template.sql`. 
        Execute the chosen file. You now have a test database that is available for the app to use, and a GUI to 
        interact with the database. If you wish to use the command line, enter `docker exec -it gifsync_db_1 bash` and 
        once you are in the container's terminal, enter `psql -U postgres`.
    * Linux
        * Follow steps 1 & 2 in [Environment Setup (Local)](#environment-setup-local), then run the following commands:
        ```sh
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install postgresql
        # If you don't set the password to "devpassword", you will need to modify the password used in the code, 
        # or utilize environment variables and define a port in web.env
        # It is recommended that you set a strong password when running postgres locally on your machine like this.
        sudo passwd postgres
        sudo su - postgres
        psql -U postgres -d postgres -a -f /absolute/path/to/project/db_template.sql
        ```
    * Windows
        * Follow steps 1 & 2 in [Environment Setup (Local)](#environment-setup-local) to get the `db_template.sql` file
        * [Download][postgres-windows-url] and install PostgreSQL and PgAdmin installer
        * Use PgAdmin to run the `db_template.sql` file

### Environment Setup (Local)
 
1. Fork the Repository on GitHub
    * It is recommended that you fork the repository so you can push changes and submit pull requests.

2. Clone the forked Repository locally
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/gifsync.git
    cd gifsync
    ```

3. (Optional) Create a Python virtual environment
    * Linux
        ```sh
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install python3-venv
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * Windows
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```

4. Install required modules
    * Linux
        ```sh
        python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    * Windows
        * Replace "python3" with "python" in the Linux commands above

5. Create two new files called **web.env** and **db.env** within the project's root directory.
    * Populate **db.env** with the following:
        ```
        POSTGRES_USER=postgres
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpassword
        ```
    * **web.env** must have `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` defined (see 
    [Additional Information](#additional-information) for getting a Spotify Client & Secret ID). Populate **web.env** 
    with the following:
        ```
        CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
        CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
        ```
    * Optional values for **web.env** include:
        * `FLASK_ENV` - not necessary to set, defaults to: `development`
        * `DATABASE_URL` - if you are connecting to an external database or have defined a different user/password than 
        what is in **db.env** file above
        * `SECRET_KEY` - not necessary to set, defaults to `devkey`
        * `PORT` - not necessary to set, defaults to `8000`

6. Run the server
    * Linux
        ```sh
        python3 -m run
        ```
    * Windows
        * Replace "python3" with "python" in the Linux commands above
    * To view the site, open a browser and go to localhost:PORT (PORT defaults to 5000 if not set as an environment 
    variable or modified in `run.py`)

## Making Changes
1. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/SomeFeature`)
2. Make some changes and stage them (`git add .`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some Feature'`)
    - If you make multiple commits, please [squash them][squash-url] into a single commit before Pushing or opening a Pull request
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/SomeFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub

## Additional Information
* You need to have a [registered App with Spotify][spotifydev-url] in order to get a Client ID and Client Secret.
* You can use your favorite Python IDE, however I recommend using [PyCharm][pycharm-url] as it allows for built-in VCS 
support and virtual environments, and an awesome plugin (EnvFile) for adding environment variables at runtime.
* When making changes to HTML/CSS, browsers will cache the files for faster load times so you may not see your changes 
if you refresh the page. To fix this, do a Hard Reload of the page. In Chrome/Firefox the command is `Ctrl+Shift+R`, in 
Edge/IE the command is `Ctrl+F5`, and in Safari the command is hold `Shift` and click the Refresh button.
* Keep your fork up-to-date by adding this repository as an upstream:
    * `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Septem151/gifsync.git`
    * Fetching and merging diffs:
        ```sh
        git fetch upstream
        git checkout some-local-branch    # some-local-branch is the local branch you want to merge updates into
        git merge upstream/some-branch    # some-branch is the branch from this repository you want to merge updates from
        ```
